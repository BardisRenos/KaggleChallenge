# Kaggle_Challenge

This repo demonstrates a Kaggle challenge ragarding cancer prostate [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment). In this challenge has purpose to predict each patient the grade of the cancer. In order to achieved that, I created a transfer learning model by using ResNet50. However, image pre-processing is needed first, before "feeding" the neural network. 



### Data set

The data set is constructed through 10616 images which each image corrensponds to a single patient.
